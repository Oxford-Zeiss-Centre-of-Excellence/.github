The KIR and IDRM have developed a unique and personal relationship with Carl Zeiss GMBH to form the Oxford-ZEISS Centre of Excellence in Biomedical Imaging (Oxford-ZCoE). This relationship allows users unrivalled access to state-of-the-art technologies and world-leading expertise. We have created an environment where our researchers and collaborators can truly tailor their microscopy experience and work directly with ZEISS R&D to realise their imaging needs.
